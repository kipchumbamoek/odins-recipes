    <h2>How to make Chapati</h2>
    <p>Chapati is an East African bread</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
       <li>2 1/2 cup whole wheat flour</li>
       <li>water as required</li>
       <li>salt as required</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon ghee</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li> Add 3 cups of flour in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add salt, sugar, 2 tbsp of oil and 1 Â½ cups of water in a separate jar/ bowl. Stir until the salt and sugar dissolves.</li>
        <li>Add the liquid mixture in step 2 in the flour bowl (step 1) and mix well.</li>
        <li> Keep kneading for 10 minutes and add flour if needed until the dough becomes non-sticky.</li>
        <li>After the 40 minutes, divide the dough into 10 - 15 equal parts making ball like shapes.</li>
        <li>Dust flour in the flat place and take one of the balls and start rolling with a rolling pin to a circular shape</li>
        <li> Next, start rolling each of the coil-like shape doughs with the rolling pin to form a circular shape again.</li>
        <li> In a hot pan, place the rolled out circular chapati and fry each side with little oil until its golden brown on medium heat. </li>
        <li> Repeat this step to the rest of the coil-like dough.</li>
